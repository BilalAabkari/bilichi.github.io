##Project Analysis:

###Target user profile

The final user of this website will be a technology company, since it is a CV oriented to apply for a computer engineering job. 
It would be a company specialized in software development. 
Specifically, I’ll assume that I’m applying to company that develops software for 3D applications (lighting algorithms, rendering software, 3D addons…)
Therefore, it is expected in this website to appear a profile image and our personal information (name, phone, email…) followed by a description about our skills and career.
A portfolio will be included, which will contain projects with a theme in line with the company's activity

##Information architecture:
This will be a single-page website, written with html, css and javascript. 
It will have a menu to quickly scroll down and navigate to a specific section, like skills or languages. 
This website will be fully responsive, so please, check it by seeing the website in a phone view! In mobile devices a sliding menu will appear (triggered by a 3 line button)

##Visual Design
The color palette of this website will consist on red and black colours, with white letters for easier reading. 
It will consist on a left section, which will contain contact info and skills, and a right section with the rest of the information.
There will be included a portfolio.
 

Regarding typography, as it is a formal document, I should use Arial or Calibri. 
Moreover, the final user is a software development company, so we should keep it simple and formal. 
If it were an art company, then I may need to do something more creative. However, it’s not the case.
The page layout will consist on a left-sided section with personal information, and a right side section with the rest of the information. 
I will also have a header with my name and a profile image.
